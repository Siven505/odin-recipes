    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Originating from Sicily, granita is the refreshing treat enjoyed in a café with a brioche and, if you choose to indulge, covered with whipped cream!  I ate so many granitas this summer in Sicily, sometimes even twice a day. Most are familiar with traditional lemon flavored granita but since travelling to Sicily I’ve discovered so many wonderful new flavors.  Each time we asked for the list of flavors available at a café, I marveled at the choices.  Here are the ones I recall: lemon; peach; strawberry; mulberry; pistachio; almond; coffee and even ricotta!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups blueberries</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
