        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>These old-fashioned pancakes will make your mouth water with this great recipe, which I found from my grandma's recipe stash! These Pancakes are better than Cracker barrels pancakes! My Great-Memaw passed down this recipe when her hands started to shake back in 1984. My family keeps her tradition of making these every Sunday morning before the 9:00 service. Thought it would be time to share her recipe on the net with all of the new moms wanting traditions for their own families. These pancakes are a perfect mixture of maple and vanilla you barely need syrup. they are easy to stir your youngins can help in the kitchen. the soft fluff of the breakfast is a wonderful start to any day.</p>
